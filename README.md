# ece-dalpolat-portfolio
Hello! I'm Ece Dalpolat, a dedicated AI Engineer and data science enthusiast currently pursuing a Master's degree in Information Technologies. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Kırklareli University and am actively expanding my expertise in data science and machine learning at Işık University. In my current role as an AI Engineer, I work extensively with Large Language Models (LLMs), semantic search, and vector databases to build intelligent systems capable of contextual understanding and natural language interaction. My responsibilities include developing and optimizing deep learning models, integrating external APIs, and deploying AI services in scalable and containerized environments using Docker and Kubernetes. I have a strong foundation in modern AI tools and frameworks including FastAPI, DSPy, ANTLR, and LangChain. My work emphasizes efficiency, modularity, and explainability in AI systems. I am passionate about building innovative solutions that bridge the gap between raw data and real-world applications. My commitment to continuous learning is reflected in the diverse projects I've contributed to, certifications I've earned in AI and ML, and my active participation in technical communities. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can experiment, learn, and deliver high-impact solutions.
